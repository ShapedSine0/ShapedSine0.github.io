      <p>We all use artificial intelligence in one way or another many times a day. Don’t believe me, look around. What devices around you have the ability to “think” and “learn” about you and the environment it’s in. Your phone for sure is one, looking for the best routes to get from home to work in a maps app. Or by seeing what you browse constantly on the internet. Your laptop does similar things as well. Those little assistants like Siri, and Cortana to name a few love to learn how to help you solve problems, which makes your life a little easier. Some smart thermostats start to learn patterns on your temperature preferences so they can do all the work. Heck why do you think Google makes so much money? Because it knows more about you than most of your friends ever will know. </p>
<p>AI runs our daily lives, and it’s only getting smarter and smarter by the day, projects push further and further into the uncanny future where AI becomes increasingly more intelligent. But what does this have in stake for the future of humanity? Will AI take over our lives, and leave us useless? Will there be a limit to what it can complete? Or will it save our lives, and make us better than we were before?</p>
<p>Let’s start off by defining what “Artificial Intelligence” means. One of the chapters from the  “Studies in Cognitive Systems” (COGS,volume 4) written by James H. Fetzer, is titled “What is Artificial Intelligence”. James is part of the Department of Philosophy in the University of Minnesota Duluth, giving strong credibility in the topic. The chapter takes apart the question in a very literal and analytical way. Starting with just “artificial” there is a common notion about its origins being formed from an unnatural source, being “ingenuine” compared to natural forms of intelligence (Fetzer, J. H.1990). The form of intelligence is created by humans, and wouldn’t be found in any normal natural way. We didn’t find computers or lightbulbs in the wild over time, we created them “artificially” per se, so that we could make life better and easier. </p>
<p>Going onto the next word “intelligence”, “Webster’s New World Dictionary (1988), defines intelligence as<br>“a) the ability to learn or understand from experience; ability to acquire and retain knowledge; mental ability;<br>b) the ability to respond quickly and successfully to a new situation; use of the faculty of reason in solving problems, directing conduct, etc., effectively;<br>c) in psychology, measured success in using these abilities to perform certain tasks”<br>The first definition from the Webster’s Dictionary (definition a.) gives the most accepting definition, where anything that retains can take on a new behavior, based on a new event that it takes knowledge from, is called intelligent. There are many different definitions for the word intelligent, and there are lots of ways people can classify it, which philosophers often debate around. For example does emotion imply intelligence&#x2F;is it needed to define intelligence? For the basic understanding of what is commonly accepted as Artificial Intelligence, we can define it as a man made thing that learns from what it knows, and adjusts based on what it knows. This can come in very different forms, from artificial intelligences that play chess, to AI’s that determine how to drive a car. The definition is broad, but artificial intelligence itself can be really broad. That’s one of the many unique things about it: it can be applied to almost anything in any way that one would like to. </p>
<p>Now that we have the definition for artificial intelligence, we can start to analyze the different effects that artificial intelligence has on our lives. Within the source “Risks of Artificial Intelligence” by Muller V.C., there are a lot of different points that are similar to my own thoughts. It talk about the potential future where artificial intelligence has surpassed the intelligence of humans, and out ranks humans on the intellectual rankings. Artificial intelligence could now take over all of the tasks that humans are needed to think of (Muller, V. C. ,2016). From the most basic things to the most complex, an artificial intelligence could potentially have enough knowledge to solve almost any problem, which could even be the problem of how to make more of itself. Or how to make itself more protected from other things like humans. This is the grey area that everyone gets scared of when talking about artificial intelligence. With the way that artificial intelligence is growing, there is potential for one of these super intelligence networks to become real in the next couple decades. But what could something that’s smarter than us do? Some people think that we could become enslaved by artificial intelligence if it gets this smart. Others believe that there is great amounts of intelligence to be harvested with the aid of an entity that is smarter than ourselves.</p>
<p>If there was a point where we reach an artificial intelligence that was able to think and reason fully like a human mind, we’d reach some weird spots with personal ethics with this new intelligence. Muller goes over the ethics of making and experimenting with artificial intelligence in lab-like scenarios which I can relate to my thoughts on human clones. An artificial intelligence that’s created could potentially have all feelings of a human brain, love, hate, sadness, hurt, etc. Making the experimentation on artificial intelligence immoral, as generally our ethics are to not harm anything that can feel. Which can be related to the ethics on human clones, where generally people think that a clone isn’t considered “human” which we can dive into the philosophy on what defines a human. It generally goes against how “artificial” was defined before. Where a human is naturally made from procreation, and not from a lab dish. We see that a human clone isn’t natural, but is artificial just like artificial intelligence. But we still see that they both could have feelings, making experimentation immoral. These are lines that we have to define for studying artificial intelligence, and we have to understand how it can shape our near future. If we get so complex with artificial intelligence that it claims to have feelings and sentience, does it make it unethical to study and take apart? How would it work if artificial intelligence has a higher intelligence rating than humans? </p>
<p>There are lots of sources that provide evidence on different limits that artificial intelligences have, that put us further away from a world with complete artificial intelligence domination. Within the Evaluation section of W.F. Lawless’s “Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence: A Threat or Savior?”, it goes over the different reasons why super intelligent AI is not likely. It goes through how no artificial intelligence has been able to recreate the “human-human interaction” sufficiently enough to become a threat to society, and the only thing an AI is good for is the physical, predictable world (W.F. 2018). Within a reality, every human has their own interpretation of that reality, on converging these interpretations to understand one interpretation, it will always be left incomplete, leaving different aspects of unique uncertainty. Wherein you can’t observe and predict as an individual, but as a team. Which lays down the floor for why complete autonomy can’t be achieved, as you can’t observe reality without a team (W.F. 2018).</p>
<p>Some more limits can come for the ethical world that us humans live in everyday, and the complications that an artificial intelligence will have trying to take that on. Paraman and Anamalah’s “Ethical artificial intelligence framework for a good AI society: principles, opportunities and perils” goes in depth on the thought of ethics in artificial intelligence. There’s no doubt that ethics should be implemented into any AI that has potential to interfere and change a human life. We personally as humans make choices based on how others feel and react all the time. One difficulty of implementing these ethics that’s explained in the introduction, is sensorimotor skills. As sensorimotor skills are often very hard for an artificial intelligence to replicate, and interpret, because artificial intelligences are built off of logical operations, like math, relationships, encoding (Paraman, 2022). This is one of the biggest hits on why people think we can’t get a fully sentient artificial network. Because we can’t artificially make something that is a one to one copy of the human mind, without having all the things that a human mind has. Which is a vastly complex subject that is constantly being studied more and more. </p>
<p>As long as there is a good way to implement these intelligences, we can really improve lots of the high accuracy jobs in the world. In “Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence: A Threat or Savior?” by W.F. Lawless, there are many different arguments made on the future of artificial intelligence, going to show that there is a safer world ahead with artificial intelligence implemented in certain tasks. Throughout the text, there are many examples of different tasks for an artificial intelligence to autonomously complete which would help out humans greatly. Some of the mentioned tasks in the introduction are tasks that “reduce human errors in the use of advanced technologies (e.g., air- planes, trains, cars)” (W.F., 2018). There is also a chapter dedicated to “Cybersecurity and Optimization in Smart “Autonomous” Buildings” (W.F., 2018). These examples along with others show the potential for humans to grow with AI, and to ultimately make their lives much easier. You’re life right now contains things that have smaller artificial intelligence that try to help you out already, with phones and smart home devices as an example. But with these intelligences as described above, you could drive across the world with little to no human input, relying on the artificial network to do it’s thing. Making the trip less of a burden on you personally, and preventing any mistakes in driving that you might do. Like swerving, or missing obstacles or hazards. Reducing these human errors can aid in progressing research and keeping things predictable. </p>
<p>Some of these thoughts on making jobs easier also have another side to them as well. Lots of people get concerned on whether or not artificial intelligence will take over their job or not. “Analyzing consequences of artificial intelligence on jobs using topic modeling and keyword extraction” by Gaur L. is a research paper, based on seeing how people feel about artificial intelligences in the workplace. Many people see that there is a value to using artificial intelligences in the workplace for efficiency and cost. But there still is a great lack in what can be done with artificial intelligence in the literal world, and in the digital world. Many companies get discredited with having basic artificial intelligence deal with their customers on the phone or in chat rooms. There isn’t enough realism that can replicate what people want in a conversation when having issues. Artificial intelligences lack in the human to human interactions that we’ve developed over time as a species, and there is still a long way before artificial intelligence can take on this definitive part of what makes us human. In the physical world of artificial intelligence, we have lots of machines that have taken the roles in workplaces like assembly lines. These machinesare very fast and precise with the work that they put out, but still come at one cost. The parts that are doing the machine work are mechanical, which can and will fail. Maintenance is still very important in this mechanical age with artificial intelligence control as well. These machines can’t strive to be good at what they do without being cared for, which is still done by tons of humans. There is a time where these machines could learn to repair themselves, but with the intricacies that lie within their physical makeup, that time lies in a distant future. Where an artificial intelligence would have to have a better understanding of how to perceive the world around them in a more organic way.</p>
<p>Regardless of how artificial intelligence comes into our life, we have to be careful with how we end up using it. There is a mention of the destructive behavior that artificial intelligence can induce on humans within Paraman’s work, if it’s not implemented properly. Where seeking basic goals to help human life, can degrade and pull apart what makes us human. (Paraman, 2022). There are a couple of broad examples that can be seen in Fig. 1 (Paraman, 2022). If an artificial intelligence get’s really good at something that you are good at, then we can automate that through the artificial intelligence. Then there becomes less and less of a purpose for you to continue doing that task in your day. Eventually over many generations the people won’t need to know how to do said task that you used to do, cause an artificial intelligence took over the task. Like if an artificial intelligence learned how to make your coffee in the morning, you won’t need to know how to make it, and probably you’re kids won’t, leading to another generation that has no idea on how coffee is made, because it’s been automated their whole lives. this can be a big problem in the bigger subjects of the world. Cause theoretically, there is a chance that we won’t need to do anything in the world, cause some artificial intelligence will be able to do it for us. </p>
<p>The process of training artificial intelligence can also be very crucial to the way that our future uses it, and how credible it can be. Artificial intelligence typically is trained with test scenarios, where the network is given data to process, and it will predict something based on that information. Like giving it pictures of cats and dogs, and it will try to answer which pictures are dogs. Then there is a review phase where a program or human will go through and tell the network if it was right or wrong for each of its predictions. This process is done tons of times, until the network can set weights on its inputs from the data to statistically predict and interpret what it sees correctly, thus it is “trained”. This can already be seen as an issue as artificial intelligences are based heavily on patterns and probabilities (Michael L., 2021). Making uncertainties in the outputs of some of these intelligences. Further on, the data that we feed these intelligences is data from the past. So as we train more and more artificial intelligences, we are using more and more data from the past, which leads to making our future “a future from the past” (Micheal L., 2021). This can arguably put us into a loop with wasted time from not creating new ideas in the world, but recycling old ideas and data. The info used from the past could also contain bias from the time the data was made. Like collection bias from the source that collected the data, selection bias from the trainer for artificial intelligence and more. </p>
<p>This overall leaves the study field of artificial intelligence in a very open state. There is still so much research to be done on what we can do to train these networks better in a more inclusive and stimulating way. Without these newer methods, and all the limitations of a logic based artificial intelligence, there is so much that needs to be done, before there’s a chance of an artificial intelligence taking over our daily lives.</p>
